%description
This C++17 library contains an abstraction layer around ZeroMQ to support
integration with Oxen authentication, RPC, and message passing.  It is designed
to be usable as the underlying communication mechanism of SN-to-SN communication
("quorumnet"), the RPC interface used by wallets and local daemon commands,
communication channels between oxend and auxiliary services (storage server,
lokinet), and also provides a local multithreaded job scheduling within a
process.
